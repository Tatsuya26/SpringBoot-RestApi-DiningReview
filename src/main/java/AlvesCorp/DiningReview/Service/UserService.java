User entity-related scenarios:
        As an unregistered user, I want to create my user profile using a display name thatâ€™s unique only to me.
        As a registered user, I want to update my user profile. I cannot modify my unique display name.
        As an application experience, I want to fetch the user profile belonging to a given display name.
        As part of the backend process that validates a user-submitted dining review, I want to verify that the user exists, based on the user display name associated with the dining review.
